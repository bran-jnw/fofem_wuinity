  To Do:
   > Need to pop up a savedialogbox when contextmenu Save item is clicked


   > Anchor  graphs in their form windows like I did with the Soil one

   > setup the business with Duff & Duff Depth change by user

   > set the fof_saf.dat, etc opens to use the Wnd_Frm.s_strupPth like
      i do with fof_spp.dat, also setup #defines for the file names

   > Fix how GUI changes when FLM class is selected, will probably need to
      set the default Log Rot, and look into what happens with Log Dist for
      FLMs
      Also type doing a User adjustment on FLM you get an error

  > Mortality Tab,  put one good row in grid, select a Species, a second
    row gets added with the species code in it, then hilight the row
    and try to delete it, it won't delete, but add something in another column
    and a new blank row is added to grid, now you can delete the 2cd row,
    seems it always wants to keep an extra row in the grid.
    Try and fix or else put a "Delete Tip" button on screen and open a window
    to explain,
     Or try making the Species column not read only and see what happens
