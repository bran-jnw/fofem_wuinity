I just started testing the new build and found some mostly minor things to change: 

1)   OK   On the mortality tab I added three species in addition to the two you have by default. The mortality equation for LAOC CRCABE doesn’t require DBH but when it is missing in FOFEM I get an error. 

2)   DBH is required for thie (White Fire)   The DBH field  for ABCO (row 2) shows DBH as required but it isn’t required for CRCABE equations.

3)   OK   The error says LAOC is row 2 but it is row 3

4)  OK Bole Char only occur in Southeast    I don’t see any BOLCHR equations in the species dropdown. Maybe you already told me they wouldn’t be there but I assume you’re working on adding them?

5)   OK   Change ‘Density’ to ‘Den’

6)  OK    Change ‘Equ Type’ to ‘Eq Type’

7)   OK   Density hover help – Change ‘tree density’ to ‘Tree density (per acre)’

8) OK     Height hover help – Change ‘tree height (ft)’ to ‘Tree height (ft)’

9)  OK      C/R hover help – Change ‘live crown ratio (0-10)’ to ‘Live crown ratio (0-10)’

10) OK   CKR hover help – Change ‘Cambium Kill Ratio’ to ‘Cambium Kill Rating (0-4)’

11) OK   Bole char ht hover help – Change ‘Bole Char Height’ to ‘Bole char height (ft)’
