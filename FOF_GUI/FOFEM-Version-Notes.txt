  FOFEM
    > Dec  6 2014 - with repect to FFI tree input file, modify mortality to use crown base height or crown ratio to 
                    populate the C/R column in the FFI input mortatily tree grid
                  - had to also update the sample ffi files that are include on install
    > Dec  8 2014 - Update with new Emission_Factors.csv file, 
                    NOTE: this new file has a little different format which FOFEM checks, there's a different label 
                    on the cover type column, and the codes in that column have changed
    > Dec 12 2014 - Change default emission factor from 2 Boreal Forest to 3 Western Forest 
    > Jan  8 2015 - Implement the new Southeast Litter and Herb consumed formulas, the new southeast formulas 
                     are now an exception to the original way of all regions consuming 100 percent of litter 
                     and herb
    > Jan 12 2015 - updated fof_saf.csv and emission_factors.csv files; new default emission factor group
                     numbers set.
    > Feb 11 2015 - update the fof_nvcs.csv, fof_fccs.csv and fof_flm.csv files 
    > Feb 11 2015 - remove duff depth from reports
    > Feb 11 2015 - user entered duff load will now auto adjust the duff depth on GUI, adjustment is based on the
                     ratio of duff load/depth for the selected cover record. 
    > Feb 23 2015 - Mortality window, Post Fire Tree input grid - make dbh required for all species, modify the
                     hint text and F1 help with respect to what inputs are required for each species 

   > Mar 11 2015 - duff load and depth will auto adjust the other when either one is changed.
                  - duff reduction eqs not longer in use, redution is now based on percent of duff amount calcs.
   > Mar 17 2015 - Mortality Graph, put grid row numbers on the legend species labels 
   > Mar 25 2015 - Includes Ticket-2, changed the batch mortality output file format. 
   > Apr  2 2015 - fix the non-duff soil heating infinite loop problem, previously FOFEM was setup to catch it and pop up 
                    a window saying Soil Simulation had Failed. the fix is in the out loop of the model. 
   > May 12 2015 - Metric abreviations setup as #defines and used throughout entire program, this includes there use in the
                    Burnup Input file switchs (file used for burnup input file program feature/option)
   > May 13 2015 - Restore the old emissions factors, modify GUI back

Version  6.3.1 
   > Jun 16 2015 - Major improvements to soild model, program will also create the sample input files
                    use the GUI inputs
                 - modify burnup to consume herb/shrub at a limited number of tons per acre per minute, 
                   previously it was all consumed in the first 60 seconds,  
   > Aug  5 2015 - Run burnup from input file option, input file format changed and address the differences in burnout times
                    between file and GUI report numbers
   > Mar  8 2016 - Replace duff consumption formula with new Readon formula 
   > Mar  9 2016 - Add pre-fire fuel load values to GUI and Command Line batch output files .  
   > Mar 12 2016 - adopt new FFI input plot and tree files that contain a monitoring status column, modify GUI controls to 
                    show monitoring status appended to plot id. 
   > May  5 2016 - New SouthEast Pocosin Duff equations implemented  
   
Version   6.4   
   > July 15 2016 - change the species mortality equation file (fof_spp.dat) to a comma delimited .csv file type so it
                    can be edited in Excel    
   > Sept  8 2016 - new ponderosa pine black hills mortality formulas added 
   > Sept 19 2016 - new Pine Flatwoods cover group and consumerd formulas added    
   
   
   > Jan 25 2017 - add user selectable consumption equation feature to the batch file processing   
   > May 18 2017 - add new .csv output file menu options for major and expanded emission components 
   > July 12 2017 - change mortality post fire injury calculations to not use the Live/Kill cutoff, add
                    a 'salvage' report that does use the Live/Kill cutoff value, do the same for 
                    batch processing 
   > Oct  10 2017 - add switch to batch input file to pit the full list of 204 expanded emissions to the batch
                     output file
